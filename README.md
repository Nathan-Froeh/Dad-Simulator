# Virtual Dad Simulator

## Sumary

![Definition of Dad Joke](https://github.com/Nathan-Froeh/Dad-Simulator/blob/master/src/images/dad-joke-definition.png)

Do you like jokes that aren't funny, random useless info, and advice for any occasion?

The Virtual Dad Simulator v1 is a mobile first app that will disply the fact of the day upon entering the home page with the option to click the menu to view facts, jokes, and advice, all of which are Dad themed.

Both the Jokes and Advice default to random but also have search option to display an item at random that fits any category you choose, so long as one is on file. It will notify you if there are no available results.
The Facts page is meant to display truly 'Random Useless Info' so no search function is available to keep it that way.


## Project Specs

This solo project was completed in 4 days
The only requirements where to use and test React, Redux, and Router after coming up with an app idea from scratch, and finding an API that will allow access by a front end.
Beyond that it was up to me to figure it all out and I had a TON of fun doing that!

## Challenges

The hardest part was coming up with an idea that would be a challenge but still one I could build in a short period of time that would also be appropriate to all. The original idea was and insult generator that would send a number you choose an insult but worded like Yoda would say it, but some of the insults were a bit over the top.

Testing was the second hardest, I am a big fan of testing and have never tested Redux before and my goal was 100% test coverage which I am quite proud to have accomplished!
