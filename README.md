# Virtual Dad Simulator

## Sumary

![Definition of Dad Joke](https://github.com/Nathan-Froeh/Dad-Simulator/blob/master/src/images/dad-joke-definition.png)

Do you like jokes that aren't funny, random useless info, and advice for any occasion?
The Virtual Dad Simulator v1 will disply the fact of the day upon entering the home page with the option to click the menu to view facts, jokes, and advice, all of which are Dad themed.
Both the Jokes and Advice default to random but also have search option to display an item at random that fits any category you choose, so long as one is on file. It will notify you if there are no available results.
The Facts page is meant to display truly 'Random Useless Info' so no search function is available to keep it that way.

## Project Specs

This solo project was completed in 4 days
The only requirements where to use and test React, Redux, and Router after coming up with an app idea from scratch, and finding an API that will allow access by a front end.
Beyond that it was up to me to figure it all out
